TODO list for piface package

o write Makefile / ant script to automate build of the jar and copy it to inst/java

o fix bug that makes R hang when quitting a menu and launching piface() again;
  upon closing the piface window (in ESS), the following message appears
  
  Java requested System.exit(0), closing R.

  Process R finished at Sat Jan 31 21:42:15 2009

  Maybe a version of piface can be compiled that replaces the System.exit(0) with
  something more appropriate for its used embedded in an R package ?
  
o add more dialogs to immediately navigate to a particular design

o include a full hierarchical tree of all menus in a package vignette (nice LaTeX diagram)
  and perhaps a text representation in ?piface
