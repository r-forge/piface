Things to do on the Java side...

-- Fix 7 warnings relating to varargs objects that come up when compiling
to a 1.5 target. DONE 4 Feb 2009

-- Fix 39 warnings observed using -Xlint:unchecked.  These have to do
with potentially unsafe operations that can be made safe via appropriate
generic declarations now available in Java 1.5. 

-- Fix 100 warnings observed using -Xlint:deprecated.
These have to do with using Java 1.1 methods such as show() instead
of setVisible(true).

-- Create a branch for the standalone version (that will run without R)
and where the current source files for rvl.stat.dist will go.  Replace 
most of the stuff in rvl.stat.dist with equivalent calls to R functions, 
via JRI.  Henceforth, we'll make piface.jar using the standalone
branch and Rpiface.jar using the trunk.

-- Modernize the GUI components to use swing rather than old awt.

-- Modernize the help files to HTML format and revise help facility
to display them using that toolkit.

-- Lots more to consider once the above are addressed.
