This dialog provides a simple online-tables
capability for common distributions.  Use the
drop-down list to choose the distribution,
and set the desired parameter values in the
right-hand panel.

In the left panel, we set the value of x and
observe the value of the cdf, F(x) (or 1 - F(x) 
if "right tail" is checked).  If you change the
value of F(x), then x is set to the corresponding 
quantile of the distribution.  (In the case of
the binomial and Poisson, only certain discrete
values of F(x) may occur.)

Fractional degrees of freedom are supported for
the t, F, and chi-square distributions.  Noncentral
versions of these distributions are available by
setting the noncentrality parameter 'ncp'.  For
ordinary central distributions, set ncp = 0.
