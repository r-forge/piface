This dialog provides for power analysis of a one-sample
test of proportions.  You have your choice of the normal
approximation, the beta approximation (which is more
accurate), or an exact calculation based on the binomial
distribution.  In the latter case, the size of the test
is often much smaller than the stated significance level.
