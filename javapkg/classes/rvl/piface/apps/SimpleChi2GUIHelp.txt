This dialog provides rudimentary power analysis of a
chi-square test.  Using prototype data of sample size n*,
compute the chi-square statistic Chi2*.  Enter n* and
Chi2* in the windows provided; these define the effect
size to use in the power calculations.

The prototype data should be fake data constructed to
reflect the effect size of clinical or scientific
importance.  Use the analysis you plan to do on these
fake data to obtain the chi-square value Chi2* for the
dialog.  The prototype data should include the expected
frequencies (or whatever), but should not include random
fluctuations.
